# Bodo Examples

Bodo is an HPC-style framework built around native Python. It provides serious performance improvements to your code with its compiler technology. These examples are adapted from the [Bodo.ai example repository](https://github.com/Bodo-inc/Bodo-examples).

> **Note**: Bodo works best for very large datasets, so downloading the data used in the examples can take some time. Please be patient while the datasets download for each example - you will see the speed benefits of Bodo when manipulating the downloaded data.

There are two types of examples in this repository - notebook and terminal. The notebook examples run in a Jupyter notebook session using iPyParallel. The terminal example runs using mpiexec in a terminal environment.

The free Bodo Community Edition allows for using Bodo on up to 8 parallel cores. If you have a Bodo Enterprise license key, add it as an environment variable (under advanced settings) in the resource definition screen to run the examples on more than 8 cores.
