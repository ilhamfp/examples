# Shiny Styling Workshop

This example is for the interactive workshop on how to style shiny apps.

* **workshop-app** - the app you'll be modifying as part of the workshop.
* **final-app** - the final version of the app that you can use as a comparison point.
* **raw-files** - some base files we'll use for styling.

You can watch the recording of the presentation on the [Saturn Cloud website](https://saturncloud.io/events/webinar-2022-06-nolis-shiny/).
